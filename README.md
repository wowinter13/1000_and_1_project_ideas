Guys from Quandl did this trick.
1. They started tracking for Buffett's jets and watching all flights.
2. After that, they found companies' offices (*from the above cities*), where Berkshire Hathaway had some interest.
3. *Magic.* Sort all given data by flight  quantity and frequency.
4. PROFIT: **Anadarko Petroleum**. Buffett had visited \$OXY a couple of times right before the $10 billion deal was publicly announced.

*In 2016, vinyl sales hit a 28-year high – and there’s no slowing it down! Maybe it’s time to restart the business model.*
