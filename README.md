**MVP:**
At this stage, a Telegram/Twitter bot would be enough. For some inspiration, you could check these links: https://t.me/headlines_for_traders, https://t.me/fin_twitt, https://t.me/StockNews100
The only problem – possible news duplications, can be solved using algos such as `Word2vec` or `Doc2vec`.

Guys from Quandl did this trick.
1. They started tracking for Buffett's jets and watching all flights.
2. After that, they found companies' offices (*from the above cities*), where Berkshire Hathaway had some interest.
3. *Magic.* Sort all given data by flight  quantity and frequency.
4. PROFIT: **Anadarko Petroleum**. Buffett had visited \$OXY a couple of times right before the $10 billion deal was publicly announced.


### 4. ML-darkpools

**Description**
*(A dark pool is a privately organized financial forum or exchange for trading securities. Dark pools allow institutional investors to trade without exposure until after the trade has been executed and reported. Dark pools are a type of alternative trading system (ATS) that give certain investors the opportunity to place large orders and make trades without publicly revealing their intentions during the search for a buyer or seller. @Investopedia)*

When a trader places an order to buy stocks, the stock exchange matches it with a counter one – to sell. ML middleware could split this order into smaller composite parts.
So we reduce the impact of the trade on the market price -> optimizing the process of trading for big and complex positions.


**Why now?**
Here we have a strong interest from small/medium-sized funds, which can't use darkpools from such guys as Morgan Stanley or other big banks, but still don't want to move some penny stock prices (or emerging market stocks) simply because of the rebalancing.

**Why now?**

*In 2016, vinyl sales hit a 28-year high – and there’s no slowing it down! Maybe it’s time to restart the business model.*
